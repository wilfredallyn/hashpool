# Minimum Difficulty Implementation - Architectural Fix

## Problem Statement

Currently, `[ehash] minimum_difficulty = 32` is used to prevent CPU miners from flooding the pool with low-value shares. However, the implementation constrains **hashrate** instead of **share difficulty**, which breaks vardiff for high-speed miners.

**Current flow:**
```
minimum_difficulty (32)
  → min_individual_miner_hashrate (0.43 GH/s)
  → Clamps ALL targets to <= 2^32 difficulty
  → High-speed miners (1.2 TH/s) get wrong targets
  → Hashrate shows as 0.6 H/s instead of 1.2 TH/s
```

## Root Cause

Two different concepts are conflated:
1. **Minimum share difficulty** - "Don't accept shares with less than X leading zeros"
2. **Minimum channel hashrate** - "Don't open channels for miners with less than X H/s"

The current code uses minimum_difficulty (a share-level constraint) to derive minimum_hashrate (a channel-level constraint), which is mathematically wrong.

## Recommended Solution

Separate concerns into two independent subsystems:

### 1. Share Validation Layer (NEW)

**Apply minimum_difficulty as a hard constraint on accepted shares.**

**Where:** During share validation, after target check passes

**How:**
```
For each share submitted:
  1. Check: hash < channel_target  [existing check]
  2. NEW: Check: hash has >= minimum_difficulty leading zeros
  3. If both pass → Accept share
  4. If #2 fails → Reject with "share-difficulty-too-low"
```

**Implementation:**

Add to `ehash` protocols:
```rust
// protocols/ehash/src/work.rs
pub fn get_leading_zero_bits(hash: [u8; 32]) -> u32 {
    // Count leading zeros in big-endian representation
    let mut count = 0u32;
    for byte in hash {
        if byte == 0 {
            count += 8;
        } else {
            count += byte.leading_zeros();
            break;
        }
    }
    count
}
```

Add to translat validator:
```rust
// translator/src/lib/utils.rs validate_sv1_share()
pub fn validate_sv1_share(
    share: &client_to_server::Submit,
    target: Target,
    minimum_difficulty: Option<u32>,  // NEW: From config
    // ... other params
) -> Result<bool, TproxyError> {
    // ... existing validation ...

    if hash_as_target < target {  // Existing check
        // NEW: Additional minimum difficulty check
        if let Some(min_bits) = minimum_difficulty {
            let leading_zeros = get_leading_zero_bits(hash);
            if leading_zeros < min_bits {
                return Err(TproxyError::ShareDifficultyTooLow {
                    required: min_bits,
                    actual: leading_zeros,
                });
            }
        }
        return Ok(true);
    }
    Ok(false)
}
```

Similarly for pool:
```rust
// pool/src/lib/mining_pool/message_handler.rs handle_submit_shares_standard()
let res = standard_channel.validate_share(m.clone());

// Add minimum difficulty check
if let Some(min_bits) = self.config.minimum_difficulty() {
    let leading_zeros = get_leading_zero_bits(block_header_hash);
    if leading_zeros < min_bits {
        return error response "share-difficulty-too-low";
    }
}

match res {
    Ok(ShareValidationResult::Valid(...)) => { ... }
}
```

### 2. Channel Hashrate Layer (INDEPENDENT)

**Minimum hashrate becomes a pool-policy knob, separate from ehash.**

**Where:** Channel creation and updates (already implemented correctly!)

**How:** Keep existing clamping logic BUT make it use independent config

**Configuration:**

```toml
# config/shared/pool.toml

[ehash]
# Minimum difficulty (leading zero bits) required to earn 1 ehash unit
# ONLY used for: share validation threshold
minimum_difficulty = 32

[pool]
# NEW: Independent from ehash!
# Minimum hashrate for channel creation (prevents resource starvation)
# Set to 0 to disable (allow any hashrate)
min_downstream_hashrate = 100000000  # 100 MH/s
```

Update code:
```rust
// roles/pool/src/lib/config.rs
pub struct PoolConfig {
    pub min_downstream_hashrate: Option<f32>,  // NEW: replaces deriving from ehash
    // ... rest of config
}

// roles/pool/src/lib/mining_pool/mod.rs
fn handle_open_standard_mining_channel(...) {
    let mut nominal_hash_rate = m.nominal_hash_rate;

    // Clamp only to independent pool minimum (not ehash minimum!)
    if let Some(min) = self.min_downstream_hashrate {
        if nominal_hash_rate < min {
            nominal_hash_rate = min;
        }
    }

    StandardChannel::new_for_pool(
        channel_id,
        user_identity,
        extranonce_prefix,
        requested_max_target.into(),
        nominal_hash_rate,  // No longer constrained by ehash minimum_difficulty
        // ...
    )?;
}
```

### 3. Remove Bad Derivation

**Delete or deprecate:** `derive_min_hashrate_from_difficulty()`

```rust
// DELETE from roles/pool/src/lib/mining_pool/mod.rs line 96
// DELETE from roles/translator/src/lib/config.rs set_min_hashrate_from_difficulty()
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Solves the Hashrate Display Bug
- High-speed miners (1.2 TH/s) no longer get targets constrained by ehash minimum
- Vardiff can set appropriate targets for any hashrate
- Hashrate metrics display correctly

### ✅ Maintains CPU Miner Protection
- Minimum share difficulty is enforced at validation layer
- CPU miners submitting < 32 bit difficulty shares get rejected
- No resource waste from low-difficulty spam

### ✅ Independent Configuration
- `[ehash] minimum_difficulty` - Protocol requirement (32 bits for this pool)
- `[pool] min_downstream_hashrate` - Pool policy (can be 0, 100M, 1G, etc.)
- Can adjust independently without affecting each other

### ✅ Clear Semantics
- Share validation: "Must have >= 32 leading zero bits"
- Channel creation: "Must claim >= 100 MH/s hashrate"
- Both are meaningful and independent

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Add Share Validation Check
1. Implement `get_leading_zero_bits()` in ehash protocols
2. Add minimum_difficulty check to translator's `validate_sv1_share()`
3. Add minimum_difficulty check to pool's `handle_submit_shares_standard/extended()`
4. Test: CPU miner with low-difficulty shares gets rejected

### Phase 2: Add Independent Pool Config
1. Add `min_downstream_hashrate` to pool config struct
2. Update pool TOML config with new setting
3. Change clamping logic to use new setting
4. Keep translator's config as-is (doesn't need this, uses vardiff)

### Phase 3: Remove Bad Derivation
1. Remove `derive_min_hashrate_from_difficulty()` function
2. Remove `set_min_hashrate_from_difficulty()` from translator config
3. Remove minimum_difficulty usage from pool's min_individual_miner_hashrate derivation

### Phase 4: Verify
1. CPU miner with 100 MH/s claiming 1 TH/s → gets channel opened, but low-diff shares rejected
2. BitAxe Gamma (1.2 TH/s) → gets correct targets, hashrate displays as 1.2 TH/s
3. Vardiff still functions correctly for any hashrate

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Strict Minimum (Current Intent)
```toml
[ehash]
minimum_difficulty = 32  # 32 leading zeros

[pool]
min_downstream_hashrate = 100000000  # 100 MH/s minimum
```

**Effect:**
- Shares must have >= 32 leading zeros (enforced at validation)
- Channels need >= 100 MH/s claimed hashrate (enforced at channel creation)
- Miners claiming >= 100 MH/s but submitting low-difficulty shares get disconnected

### Example 2: Permissive (Development)
```toml
[ehash]
minimum_difficulty = 16  # Lower threshold for testing

[pool]
min_downstream_hashrate = 1000000  # 1 MH/s (almost no constraint)
```

**Effect:**
- Share validation is permissive
- Channel creation is permissive
- Useful for testing with simulation/CPU miners

### Example 3: No Minimum (Ultra Permissive)
```toml
[ehash]
minimum_difficulty = 0  # No share validation

[pool]
min_downstream_hashrate = null  # No channel constraint
```

**Effect:**
- All shares accepted
- Any hashrate accepted
- Useful for early development

## Code Locations to Modify

### Add Share Validation:
- `protocols/ehash/src/work.rs` - Add `get_leading_zero_bits()`
- `translator/src/lib/utils.rs` - Add check in `validate_sv1_share()`
- `pool/src/lib/mining_pool/message_handler.rs` - Add check after `validate_share()`

### Add Config:
- `roles/pool/src/lib/config.rs` - Add `min_downstream_hashrate` field
- `config/shared/pool.toml` - Add `[pool] min_downstream_hashrate` setting
- `roles/pool/src/args.rs` - Parse new config value

### Remove/Disable:
- `roles/pool/src/lib/mining_pool/mod.rs:96-105` - Delete `derive_min_hashrate_from_difficulty()`
- `roles/pool/src/lib/mining_pool/mod.rs:1187-1194` - Remove minimum_difficulty usage
- `roles/translator/src/lib/config.rs` - Remove `set_min_hashrate_from_difficulty()`
- `roles/translator/src/args.rs` - Stop loading minimum_difficulty from config

## Testing Strategy

### Test 1: CPU Miner with Low Shares
```
Setup: CPU miner claiming 1 MH/s, sending 8-bit difficulty shares
Config: minimum_difficulty = 32
Expected: Shares rejected with "share-difficulty-too-low"
```

### Test 2: Fast Miner with Correct Shares
```
Setup: BitAxe claiming 1.2 TH/s, sending 32+ bit shares
Config: minimum_difficulty = 32, min_downstream_hashrate = 100M
Expected: Shares accepted, hashrate metrics correct
```

### Test 3: Under-Hashrate Claim
```
Setup: Miner claiming 50 MH/s (below 100M minimum)
Config: min_downstream_hashrate = 100M
Expected: Channel clamped to 100M, shares still validated against minimum_difficulty
```

### Test 4: Mixed Scenario
```
Setup: 3 miners: CPU, BitAxe, Antminer
Config: minimum_difficulty = 32, min_downstream_hashrate = 1M
Expected: All get channels, but CPU's low-diff shares rejected
```

## Migration Path

For existing deployments, this is **backward compatible**:
- Default `min_downstream_hashrate = None` means "no constraint" (more permissive than current)
- Existing `[ehash] minimum_difficulty` still read but only used for validation
- No breaking changes to protocol or share handling
- Can roll out incrementally

## Summary

**Old architecture:** Difficulty concept leaks from share validation into channel constraints

**New architecture:** Two clean, independent layers:
1. **Share layer** - Validates shares meet minimum_difficulty threshold (ehash concern)
2. **Channel layer** - Controls channel creation with separate min_downstream_hashrate (pool concern)

Result: CPU miner protection remains, but high-speed miners work correctly and hashrate metrics are accurate.
